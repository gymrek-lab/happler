# This is the Snakemake configuration file that specifies paths and 
# and options for the pipeline. Anybody wishing to use
# the provided snakemake pipeline should first fill out this file with paths to
# their own data, as the Snakefile requires it.
# Every config option has reasonable defaults unless it is labeled as "required."
# All paths are relative to the directory that Snakemake is executed in.
# Note: this file is written in the YAML syntax (https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/)


# Paths to a SNP-STR haplotype reference panel
# You can download this from http://gymreklab.com/2018/03/05/snpstr_imputation.html
# If the VCFs are per-chromosome, replace the contig name in the file name with "{chr}"
# The VCF(s) must be sorted and indexed (with a .tbi file in the same directory)
# required!

# If SNPs are unphased, provide the path to a SHAPEIT4 map file like these:
# https://github.com/odelaneau/shapeit4/tree/master/maps
# The map file should use the same reference genome as the reference panel VCFs
# phase_map: data/genetic_maps/chr{chr}.b37.gmap.gz

# A "locus" is a string with a contig name, a colon, the start position, a dash, and
# the end position or a BED file with a ".bed" file ending
# There are different simulation modes that you can use:
# 1. "str" - a tandem repeat is a string with a contig name, a colon, and the start position
# 2. "snp" - a SNP follows the same format as "str"
# 3. "hap" - a haplotype
# 4. "ld_range" - creates random two-SNP haplotypes with a range of LD values between the alleles of each haplotype
# 5. "run" - execute happler on a locus without simulating anything
# The STR and SNP positions should be contained within the locus.
# The positions should be provided in the same coordinate system as the reference
# genome of the reference panel VCFs
# The contig should correspond with the contig name from the {chr} wildcard in the VCF
# required! and unless otherwise noted, all attributes of each mode are required
